### Welcome to some of the code I write

- I am a follower of Christ and would love to one day write software that helps draw people closer to God in one way or another.  I did do this for a little bit for http://solidrockbiblecamp.com creating a camp management software and the corresponding repo: [SRBC](https://github.com/Storms-Engineering/SRBC)
- I really enjoy working with computers and code
- Linux is definitely my favorite operating system, (I use ubuntu quite a bit, I also like debian)
- I think working in a terminal is pretty awesome
- I like JS(*gasp I know*) and C#, and C++(Not as much experience in C++ as I would like)
- I love solving complex problems in a solid and understandable way
- #codeforGod
